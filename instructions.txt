# Backend Deployment Instructions

## Steps to Deploy on Render:
1. Install Render CLI and login to your account.
2. Initialize the backend project: `render init`.
3. Deploy as a Python service:
   - Add `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
   - Use `app.py` as the entry point.
   - Include `lottery.db` in the deployment.
4. Secure the API:
   - Replace the `VALID_API_KEY` value in `app.py` with a secure key from environment variables.

## Security Features:
1. **API Key Authorization**: All requests must include the API key in the `Authorization` header.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limits requests to prevent abuse.
3. **ORM with SQLAlchemy**: Prevents SQL injection by using parameterized queries.


## Scheduled Lottery Results Scraper
To automate fetching lottery results daily, set up a cron job:

1. Run the scraper manually to test:
   ```bash
   python backend/scraper.py
   ```
2. Deploy it as a scheduled task in Render (or use a system cron job):
   ```bash
   echo "0 22 * * * python /path/to/backend/scraper.py" | crontab -
   ```
